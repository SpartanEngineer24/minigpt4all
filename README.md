# minigpt4all
Multilingual Finetuning of the MiniGPT4 project

Currently this repository is a work in progress.
The workflow is identical to the main repository's, and thus you may follow the instructions outlined in the main repository for training new models
Note that a lot of the config files are hard-coded, and thus will require updating in your own repository.
